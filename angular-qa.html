            -Maintained by Google<br />
            -It's designed for web, desktop, and mobile platforms
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:What is TypeScript?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            -It's a superset of JavaScript and offers excellent consistancy<br />
            -TypeScript is installed as an npm package, and thus can be installed with the
            following command: npm install -g typescript
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What is Data Binding?<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Which type of Data Binding Does Angular Deploy?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            -Data Binding is a process that allows an Internet user to manipulate
            Web page elements using a Web browser<br />
            -It is used in a Web page that contain intractive components such as forms, calculators
             tutorials, and games
            -Any changes in the UI element is reflected in the corresponding model state and vice versa
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What are Single Page Aplications?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            -Single page Applications load once and new features are just mere additions to the user interface<br />
            -New HTML pages are not loaded to diplay the new page's content, instead generated dynamicallly<br />
            -A SPA approach is fater, thus providing a seamless user experience

      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What are Decorators in Agular?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            -Decorators are functions that allows a service, directive or filter to be modified prior its usage<br />

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Angular supports four types of decorators:
            <ul>
              <li>Class Decorators</li>
              <li>Property Decorators</li>

            -Service Workers
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What are Teplates in Angular?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            -Angular Templates are written with HTML that contains Angular-specific elements and atributes
            -In combination with the model and controller's information, these templates are further rendered
             to provide a dynamic view to the user
            -Templates are very predominant features in Angular that describe how the information can be diplay
              in the view
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What are Annotations in Angular?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            -Annotation in Angular are used to creating an annotation array. They are metadata set on the class
             that is used to reflect the Metadata library
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What are Directives in Angular?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            -Directives are attributes that allow the user to write new HTML syntax specific to their application.
             They are executed whenever the Angular compiler finds them in the DOM.<br />

             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Angular supports three types of directives:
             <ul>
               <li>Component Directives</li>
               <li>Structural Directives</li>
               <li>Attribute Directives</li>
             </ul>
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What is AOT Compilation?</strong><br />
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -What are it's Advantages?<br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            -The Ahead-of-ttime (AOT) compiler converts the Angular html
             and TypeScript code into JavaScript code during the build phase, i.e.,
             before the browser downloads and runs the code<br />

             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Some advantages are:
             <ul>
               <li>Faster Rendering</li>
               <li>Fewer asynchronous request</li>
               <li>Smaller Angular framework downloads size</li>
               <li>Quick detection of template errors</li>
               <li>Better security</li>
             </ul>
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What are Components?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            -Components are the most basic building blocks in the UI of an application<br />
            -Every component is associated with a template, and they are a subset of directives<br />
            -Only one component can be instantiated per element in a template<br />
            -In an Angular application typically consist of the root component which is basically the @Component
              and branch out to other copmponents that creates the hierarchy.
              This @Component decorator provides additional metadata<br />
            -Component must belong to the Ng module<br />
            -Components implement Life-Cycle hooks
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What are Pipes in Angular?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            -Pipes are simple functions designated to accept an input value, process, and return as an output,
             a transformed value in a more technical understanding<br />
             <img src="assets/imgs/pipes-Angular.png" alt="Angular Pipes" width="600px"><br />

             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Some key features include:
             <ul>
               <li>Pipes are defined using the pipe "|" symbol</li>
               <li>Pipes can be chained with other pipes</li>
               <li>Pipes can be provided with arguments by using the colon ( : ) sign</li>
             </ul>
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What are pure Pipes?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            -It does not use internal state<br />
            <img src="assets/imgs/purePipes-Angular.png" alt="Angular Pure Pipes" width="600px"><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Some key features include:
            <ul>
              <li>Pure Pipes use pure functions</li>
              <li>The Pipes does not use any internal state, and the output remains the same as long
                  as the parameters passed stay the same</li>
              <li>Angular calls the Pipes only when it detects a change in the parameters being passed</li>
              <li>A single instance of the pure pipe is used throughout all components</li>
            </ul>
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What are Impure Pipes?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            -For every change detection cycle in Angular, an impure pipe is called regardless of the change
             of the imput fields. Multiple pipe instances are created for these pipes. Inputs passed to
             these pipes can be mutable<br />
            -By default, all pipes are pure. However, you can specify impure pipes using the pure property<br />

      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What is PipeTransform Interface?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            -The pipe transform interface receives an input value and transforms it into the desired format with a
             transform() method. It is typically used to implemnt custom pipes<br />
             <img src="assets/imgs/pipeTransformMethod.png" alt="Pipe Transfor Method" width="600px">
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What is NgModule?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            -NgModules are containers that reserve a block of code to an application domain or a workflow<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-@NgModule takes a metadata object that describes how to compile a componet's
              template and how to create an injector at runtime<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-NgModules identifies the modules' components, directives, services, pipes, and ensure that is
             mix in public that external componets can use them
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What are filters in Angular?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            -Filters are used to format an expression and present it to the user. They can be used in the view templates,
             controlers or services.<br />
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Some inbuild filters are:
             <ul>
               <li><strong>date:</strong> -Formats a date to a specified format</li>
               <li><strong>filter:</strong> -Slects a set of items from an array</li>
               <li><strong>Json:</strong> -Formats an object to a JSON string</li>
               <li><strong>limitTo:</strong> -Limits an array/string, into a specific number of elements/haracters</li>
               <li><strong>lowercase:</strong> -Format a string to lower case</li>
             </ul>
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What is View Encapsulation in Angular?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            -View encapdulation defines wheather the template and styles defined within the component can affecr
             the whole application or viceversa. <br />
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Angular provides three encapsulation strategies:
             <ul>
               <li><strong>Emulated:</strong> -styles from amin HTML propagate to the component</li>
               <li><strong>Native:</strong> -styles from main HTML do not propagate to the component</li>
               <li><strong>None:</strong> -styles form the component propagate back to the main HTML and
                                          therfore are visible to all components on the package</li>
               <li><strong>limitTo:</strong> -</li>
               <li><strong>lowercase:</strong> -</li>
             </ul>
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What are Controllers?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            -Angular contollers control the data of Angular applications. They are regular JavaScripts Objects.
             The ng-controller directive defines the application controller<br />
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Angular provides three encapsulation strategies:
             <ul>
               <li><strong>Emulated:</strong> -styles from amin HTML propagate to the component</li>
               <li><strong>Native:</strong> -styles from main HTML do not propagate to the component</li>
               <li><strong>None:</strong> -styles form the component propagate back to the main HTML and
                                          therfore are visible to all components on the package</li>
             </ul>
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What do you understand by Scope in Angular?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>-The scope in Angular binds the HTML, i.e., the view, and the JavaScript, i.e., the controller</li>
               <li>-It is an object with the available properties and methods</li>
               <li>-When you make a controller in Angular, you pass the $scope object as an argument</li>
               <li><strong>limitTo:</strong> -</li>
               <li><strong>lowercase:</strong> -</li>
              <li><strong>limitTo:</strong> -</li>
              <li><strong>lowercase:</strong> -</li>
             </ul>
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What are the Lifecycle Hooks in Angular?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            -In Angular, every component has a lifecycle. Angular creats and renders these components and also destroys
              them before removing them from the DOM. This is achives with the help of lifecycle hooks.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="assets/imgs/lifeCycleHooks.png" alt="Life Cycle Hooks" width="500px">
              <br />
            <ul>
              <li><strong>-ngOnChanges():</strong> -A callback method that is invoked immediately after the default change detector has checked
                data-bound properties if at least one has changed, and before the view and content children are checked.
                ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void</li>
               <li><strong>ngOnInit():</strong> -life cycle hook called by Angular to indicate that the Angular is done creating the component</li>
               <li>-When you make a controller in Angular, you pass the $scope object as an argument</li>
               <li><strong>ngDoCheck():</strong> - is the method of DoCheck interface. The DoCheck is a lifecycle hook that invokes a custom
                 change-detection function for a directive. </li>
               <li><strong>ngAfterContentInit():</strong> -A callback method that is invoked immediately after Angular has completed initialization of all of the directive's content.
                 It is invoked only once when the directive is instantiated</li>
               <li><strong>ngAfterContentChecked()</strong> -is a callback method which will get called by Angular immediately after the default change detector completes
                 checking all of the directive's content.</li>
               <li ><strong>ngAfterViewInit():</strong> -is called after Angular has fully initialized a component's views.  is used to handle any additional initialization tasks</li>
               <li><strong>ngAfterViewChecked():</strong> -A callback method that is invoked immediately after the default change detector has completed one change-check cycle for a component's view.</li>
               <li><strong>ngOnDestroy():</strong> -A callback method that performs custom clean-up, invoked immediately before a directive, pipe, or service instance is destroyed. </li>
             </ul>
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What is String Interpolation in Angular?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>

            <ul>
              <li>String Interpolation is a one-way data-binding technique that outputs the data from TypeScript code to HTML view</li>
               <li>It is denoted using double curly braces</li>
               <li>It helps display the data from the component to the view</li>
             </ul>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{{ data }}
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What are Template Statements?<br />
            <strong>A:</strong> They are methods or propeties that is used in HTML to repond to user events.<br />
            With templates statements the application can engage users through actions such as displaying dynamic content or submiting forms.<br /><br />

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#60;buton (click)="deleteHero()" &#62; Delete Hero &#60;/button&#62;<br /><br />

            The tempalte here is deletHero. The method is called when the user clicks on the button.<br />

      <li><strong>Q:-What is the Difference between AOT and JIT?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
             <ul>
               <li>Ahead of Time Compilation (AOT) converts your code during the build time before the browser downloads and runs that code<br />
                  -This ensure faster rendering to the browser<br />
                  -The user should include the --aot option with the ng build or ng serve command
               </li><br />
               <li>Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation process is a way of compiling computer code to machine code durig execution or run time<br />
                 -It is also known as dynamic compilation <br />
                 -JIT compilation is the default when you run the ng build or ng serve CLI commands
               </li>
             </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Q:-What is the @Component Decorator?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
             <ul>
               <img src="assets/imgs/ComponentDecorator.png" alt="Component Decorator sample">
               <li>A typeScript class is used to create a component which is decorated with the <i>"@Component"</i> decorator</li>
               <li>The metadata object provides properties like <strong>selector, templateURL,</strong> and so on-The teplate URL points
                   to an HTML file that defines what you see on your application

               <img src="assets/imgs/services.png" alt="Services in Angular" width="410px">
               <li>Angular Services perform task that are used by multiple components<i>"@Component"</i> decorator</li>
               <li>A component can delegate task like fetching data from the server, validating user input, or loggin directly to the console to the Services</li>
               <li>A service can be gritten once and injected into all the components that uses that service thus avoiding redundant code</li>

            <strong>A:</strong>
             <ul>
               <li>ngOnInit is a lifecycle hook and callback method that is run by Angular to indicate that a component has been created</li>
               <li>It takes no parameters and returns a void type</li>

      <li><strong>Q:-Explain the ngFor Directive</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            ngFor directive is used to iterate over an array or an object and creates a template for each element
             <ul>
               <li>"Let item" creates a local variable that will be available inside the template</li>
               <li>"Of items" indicates thta we are iterating over the items iterable</li>
               <li>The "*" before ngFor creates a parent template</li>

                  -A form value can be generated using the form.value object and formData exported as JSON values<br />
                  -Basic HTML validation can be use to validate the form fields. In the case of costum validation directives can be used

      <li><strong>Q:-What is Bootstrap? and How it is added to Angular?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            Bootstrap is a powerful toolkit -a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tools for creating a building responsive web pages and web applications
             <ul>
               <li>Bootstrap CDN</li>

      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What is Eager and Lazy Loading?</strong><br />
            <strong>A:</strong>

             <ul>
               <li>-Eager loading is the default module-loading strategy. <br />
                   Feature modules under Eager loading are loaded before the application starts.<br />
                   -This is typically used for small size applications
                 </li>
               <li>-Lazy loading dynamically loads the feature modules when there is a demand. This makes the application faster.<br />
                   -It is used for bigger applications where all the modules are not required at the start of the application
                 </li>
             </ul>
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What type of DOM does Angular Use?<br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            The Document Object Model trees in XML or HTML document at tree structure in which each node represents a part of the document.
             <ul>
               <img src="assets/imgs/DOM_type.png" alt="Angular DOM type" width="540px">
               <li>Angular uses the regular DOM which updates the entire tree structure of HTML tags until it reaches the data to be updated</li>
               <li>However, to ensure that the speed and performance are not affected, Angualr implements Change Detection</li>
             </ul>

      <li><strong>Q:-How is Dependency Injection achived in Angular?<br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            Dependencies are objects or services tht a component needs to perform functions.<br />
            Using Dependency Injection, classes can request dependencies from external souces rather than creating them.<br />
            For a demo we use:
             <ul>
               <li>ng g service demoservice</li><br />

      <li><strong>Q:-How does Angular Routing work?<br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
             <ul>
               <li>Routing helps navigate through a web application, especially in a Sinngle page Application where new content is loaded dynamically (only once)</li>
               <li>It generally specifies navigation with a forward slash followed by the path defining the new content</li>
             </ul>
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What are Form Control and Form Groups?<br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
             <ul>
               <li>Form Control:<br />
                    <img src="assets/imgs/FormControls.png" alt="Form Controls" width="450px">

      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-How is Testing Achived in Angular?<br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            Angular uses <strong>Jasmine</strong> to run various test
            <table cellspacing="20">
                <td>
                  <img src="assets/imgs/Jasmin.png" alt="Jasmin logo" width="100px">
                </td>
                <td>
                  -The <strong>Jasmine Framework</strong> allows various fuctionalities to write different kinds of test cases<br />
                  -<strong>Karma</strong> is the task-runner for the tests<br />
                  -Karma uses a <strong>configuration file</strong> to set the start-up, reporters, and testing framework
                </td>

            </table>
      </li>
      <br />
      <li><strong>Q:-What is package.json?<br />
            <strong>A:</strong>
            npm instals the package.json file when a new workspace is created<br /><br />

            The package.json file includes a starter set of packages some of which are required by Angular<br /><br />

            package.json is orgaized in two groups of packages:

             <ul>
               <li>Dependencies - These are essential to run the applications<br />
               </li>
               <li>DevDependencies - Necesary to develop applications</li>
             </ul>
      </li>
